# GENET performance history

Durable record of 10-trial `burst_stats.py` runs at N=1024, with the
purpose of each trial and the commit it was measured against. Append
new entries at the TOP so the latest work is immediately visible.

Only add an entry once you trust the result enough to make a

## 2026-04-08 — `f7e2c5e` + uncommitted probes — PERF=1 — first genet_recv probe wiring

Baseline-vs-instrumented A/B for the first wiring of `PROBE_ENTRY` /
`PROBE_EXIT` / `PROBE_COUNT_INC` into `genet_recv`. Goal: confirm probe
overhead does not significantly regress the N=1024 burst-drain
behaviour.

| metric         | default (no PERF)           | PERF=1                         |
|----------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| samples        | [1024×10]                   | [1024, 1024, 1024, 1024, 956, 1024, 1024, 1024, 1024, 1024] |
| mean           | 1024.00                     | 1017.20                        |
| stdev          | 0.00                        | 21.50                          |
| min / max      | 1024 / 1024                 | 956 / 1024                     |
| lossless runs  | **10/10**                   | 9/10                           |
| send_ms mean   | 56.52                       | 52.91                          |

**Interpretation:**
- The default kernel at current HEAD is fully lossless at N=1024 for
  the first time in this project. The earlier "real Pi-side loss" we
  thought was ~14% has now fully vanished, credit to `7087e58` (recv
  buffer + tcpreplay harness) + `868742b` (batch drain).
- PERF=1 introduces measurable probe overhead: 1 low outlier at 956
  out of 10 runs, which is consistent with a ~3% drain-rate slowdown
  pushing us over the edge on the most stressful run. Still 9/10
  lossless, so the PERF build is usable for optimization work.
- Probe overhead fits the theoretical estimate: 1 `PROBE_ENTRY` + 1
  `PROBE_EXIT` + 1 `PROBE_COUNT_INC` ≈ 40 extra cycles per successful
  recv at ~667 MHz ≈ ~60 ns/frame, ~3% of the ~1.84 µs baseline.

**Decision:** keep the commit. The probes do their job without
breaking functional behavior, the overhead is bounded and
understood, and we now have the instrumentation substrate the rest
of the grind depends on.
